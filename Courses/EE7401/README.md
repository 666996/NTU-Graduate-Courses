# EE7401 - Probability and Random Processes

### Learning Objective:

The aim of this course is to introduce the concepts and computational tools of probability and random processes to the solution of problems that occur in the analysis of signals and systems. The intended audience consists of research students primarily working in signal processing, detection, estimation, and pattern classification. It is assumed that students of this course have minimum background in probability theory but wish to study subjects such as communication engineering, information theory, noise theory, reliability theory, or random vibrations in which probabilistic methods are applied. The emphasis will be on material that has direct application to important engineering systems such as radar, sonar and communications.

### Desired Outcome:

After completing this course, the student will have:
- Gained some familiarity with the application of probability and random processes in engineering problems.
- A working knowledge of some probabilistic and stochastic computational tools.
- The ability to do performance calculations, such as the receiver operating characteristic of communication and detection systems.

### Other Relevant Information:

The student will need to have a mathematical background that includes calculus and some linear algebra, as well as some exposure to signal analysis and linear systems.

### Content:

Probability concepts. Random variables. Multiple random variables. Sum of random variables and multidimensional distributions. Random Sequences. Probability density function estimation. Random variable simulation. Random processes. Correlation functions. Spectral density. Random processes in linear systems. Optimum linear systems. Nonlinear systems.
