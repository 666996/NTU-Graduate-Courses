# EE7402 - Statistical Signal Processing

### Learning Objective:

This course serves as an introduction to the field of statistical signal processing. It aims at covering certain basic techniques of signal detection and estimation, and adaptive filtering. These are the essential techniques that have been used in many application fields such as signal processing, controls and communications.

### Content:

Signal Estimation Theory. Properties of Estimators. Fundamentals of Detection Theory. Detection of Deterministic and Random Signals. Application of Signal Detection and Estimation. Introduction to Adaptive Filtering. Gradient based Adaptation. Adaptive Filter Applications.

### Learning Outcome:

The basic concepts and techniques to be taught at a sufficient depth to enable the students to have enough background for practical applications or for better understanding their application fields such as signal processing, controls and communications. The learning outcome would be that the student is fully equipped with the theoretical background to select suitable algorithms for their applications and to be well equipped to pursue R & D work.
