# EE7204 - Linear Systems

### Learning Objective:

Linear system theory is the core of modern control and signal processing. It has applications in control, signal processing and communications. The aim of this course is to equip students with a solid understanding of the fundamentals of linear systems analysis and design using the state space approach.

### Desired Outcome:

On completion of the subject, students will have a fundamental understanding of linear systems theory and will be able to apply linear system analysis and design tools to various engineering problems.

### Other Relevant Information:

Minimum requirement for the course is some background in signals and systems and linear algebra.

### Content:

Input/Output System Models. State Space Representation. Norms of Signals and Systems. Decomposition of Linear Time-Invariant Systems. Linear Feedback Design. Convex Optimization for Linear System Analysis and Design.
