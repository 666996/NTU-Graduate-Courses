# EE7401 - Probability and Random Processes

### Learning Objective:

In this course, the students will learn the basic skills that are essential to becoming a successful researcher. The objective of the course is to teach research skills in a systematic fashion, early in a student's graduate program. Lecture topics will include research methodology, experimental design, professional ethics and academic integrity, and oral and written presentation techniques. Students will be required to perform a literature survey (on a topic in their own research area), construct a research proposal that includes an experimental design, and write a paper summary in the style of a formal scientific paper.

### Desired Outcome:

On successful completion of the course, students should be able to:
- Explain the reasons for undertaking research.
- Produce a simple project proposal.
- Understand the purposes of studying the literature and be able to undertake a literature search.
- Plan experiments, taking into consideration the health and safety aspects as well as the
scientific requirements.
- Present data appropriately and deal with errors (in a simple manner).
- Understand the differing requirements for reporting research in a variety of formats
Appreciate the requirements and opportunities for protecting and exploiting research.

### Other Relevant Information:

Intensive three hours per week teaching period of lectures and tutorials, followed by assessment package of a nominal xx hours work, to be submitted before the end of the course week.

### Content:
