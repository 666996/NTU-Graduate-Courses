# EE7201 - Computational Methods in Engineering

### Learning Objective:

The course is designed to present a broad overview of computational methods for postgraduate studies in engineering. It gives the students a general but deeper understanding of numerical techniques available for solving mathematical problems in various categories, such as linear algebra, least squares, optimization, statistical decisions, stochastic simulations and differential equations, which are very commonly encountered in current engineering applications.

### Desired Outcome:

By mastering the underlying principles of the computational methods introduced in this course, the students should be aware of the relevant issues in selecting appropriate methods and using them wisely in a wide range of engineering applications, and be able to formulate the problems and interpret the results properly.

### Other Relevant Information:

This course is meant for postgraduate students in all branches of engineering. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Probability/Statistics and Differential Equations is desirable.

### Content:

Matrices. Method of Least Squares. Optimization. Case Study I - Matrix Factorization in Kalman Filtering. Statistical Methods. Monte-Carlo Methods. Numerical Solution to Differential Equations. Case Study II – Parameter Estimation and Monte-Carlo Simulation in Optics Sensing.
